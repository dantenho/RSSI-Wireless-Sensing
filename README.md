# RSSI-Wireless-Sensing
A initial project to Wireless 6 2d Mapping that uses RSSI signal atenuation.

The idea is to use limited hardware, with Wireless 6 Signal type (with subprecess modulation), withou any advance hardware feature extraction, to meansue distance between transmissor (Routers) and receptors (Cellphone) to make RSSI Signal loss between 1, 2, 3 walls.
The Dataset structure will use Z,X,Y - BandType - TX - 80mhz - SNR - Features - Distance to mean signal position. Im creatint a simple Streamlit frontend to capture data between Dispotivtives and position to meansure her location in a z,x,y axial plane. Update you guys soon
